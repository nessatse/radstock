	* Instead of just picking a first available interface as default, rather look for
	one with a vailid looking IP.  Only been tested on Centos 7

	* Added support for Dis-Req, Dis-ACK and Dis-NAK packet types
	
	* Fixed all the buffer overflow issues with output buffer and large 
	  accounting packets
	 
	* Updated to support flex
	
	* Added -S command line option to allow displaying invalid packets. 
	  By default invalid packets will be suppressed

	* Better display for VSA's.  VSA's are not fully supported (this would
	require major changes), but at least they are displayed in a more or
	less readable format.

	* Timestamps for the -T option are formatted better

	* radstock.c: Actually uses the value passed on the command line

	* Makefile.in: Passes the dictionary as a define on the command line

	* radstock.1: Added notes to clarify the logic with !=. != will
	not match packets without that attribute at all.

	* process.c: parse_packet should never return FIL_UNDEF for any
	terms. It should return TRUE on UNDEF and the operator is nexists
	and FALSE otherwise.

	* grammar.y: By sending NULL as the last parameter for exists
	operators, we caused an exception when debugging was switched on.
