	* radstock.c: Actually uses the value passed on the command line

	* Makefile.in: Passes the dictionary as a define on the command line

	* radstock.1: Added notes to clarify the logic with !=. != will
	not match packets without that attribute at all.

	* process.c: parse_packet should never return FIL_UNDEF for any
	terms. It should return TRUE on UNDEF and the operator is nexists
	and FALSE otherwise.

	* grammar.y: By sending NULL as the last parameter for exists
	operators, we caused an exception when debugging was switched on.
